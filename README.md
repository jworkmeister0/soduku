I told you guys I'd set up this repo before class. So now I'm doing it.

We are using the Scheme flavor of LISP. To work with Scheme code, we will need a Scheme compiler and interperter. Get CHICKEN (http://call-cc.org) and install it. Since we are probably going to be modifying 2 or 3 source files for the entire project, there is probably no need for fancy IDE plugins and whatnot.

Anyway, read how to use the CHICKEN compiler (http://wiki.call-cc.org/man/4/Using%20the%20compiler). Everything is done via command line and it is pretty straightforward.

I'd encourage you guys to start writing, compiling and running come Scheme code. There is a small example on the compiler Wiki page. Scheme might look a daunting, but it is actually really simple to learn once you get used to it (imo).
