The story so far:

Everything's pretty much done with the exception of:

	-nice printing (of both unsolved and solved puzzle)

	-testing (i've only tested maybe 2 puzzles)

	-Solving empty puzzles. Theres some really strange behavior when you feed the program an empty puzzle.

	-Maybe find a way for the program to solve multiple puzzles 

ALSO, sorry about the awful whitespace in the code. It looked fine on my machine. I don't know why it is so widely formatted on github
